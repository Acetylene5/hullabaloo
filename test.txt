LONDONâ€”At a press conference Tuesday, 89-year-old Rose Biggin, a grandmother
from the Camden Town neighborhood of North London, announced that she was in
fact the internationally renowned graffiti artist known only as Banksy. "Those
drawings? Oh, yes, those are mine," said the diminutive octogenarian, who
admitted to scaling buildings and climbing fences in order to put up
life-sized stenciled images that satirize modern society's mores and its
inherent political power structures. "It sure does help to pass the time."
Biggin then returned home, where along with some of her "dearest friends," she
sipped tea, sampled some nice ginger cake, and planned the necessary
destruction of dominant capitalist paradigms
